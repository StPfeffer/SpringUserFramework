## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

### Forking the Repository

To contribute to SpringUserFramework, begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This creates a personal copy of the project where you can make changes without affecting the original repository.

1. Navigate to the [SpringUserFramework repository](https://github.com/devondragon/SpringUserFramework/).
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.

### Cloning Your Fork

Next, clone your fork to your local machine to start making changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpringUserFramework.git
cd SpringUserFramework
```


### Setting Up the Upstream Remote

To keep your fork synchronized with the original repository, add it as an upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/devondragon/SpringUserFramework.git
```


This setup allows you to fetch updates from the main repository and incorporate them into your fork.

## Working on Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Before starting work, please check existing issues to avoid duplication.

1. Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/devondragon/SpringUserFramework/issues) to find something you'd like to work on.
2. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it.

### Creating a Feature Branch

For each issue, create a new branch in your local repository. This keeps your changes organized and makes it easier to manage multiple contributions.

1. Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```


2. Check out the branch associated with the issue:

   ```bash
   git checkout upstream/branch-name
   ```


3. Create a new branch off of the issue branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```


### Making Changes

Make your desired changes in your local repository. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes appropriate documentation.

### Committing Changes

Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
```


Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.

### Pushing Changes

Push your feature branch to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```


## Submitting a Pull Request

Once your changes are pushed to your fork, submit a pull request (PR) to the original repository:

1. Navigate to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button next to your feature branch.
3. Ensure the base fork is `devondragon/SpringUserFramework` and the base branch is the issue branch you're addressing.
4. Provide a clear title and description for your PR, referencing the issue number it addresses.
5. Click "Create pull request."

Your PR will be reviewed by the maintainers. Please be responsive to feedback and willing to make adjustments as needed.

## Code Style and Standards

Please adhere to the following coding standards:

- Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for Java code.
- Use meaningful variable and method names.
- Write concise and clear comments where necessary.

Consistent code style helps maintain readability and ease of maintenance.

## Testing

Ensure that your changes do not break existing tests and include new tests as appropriate. Run all tests before submitting a PR:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

